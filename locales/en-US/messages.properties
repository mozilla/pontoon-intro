# What
what-title-in-context=What is in-context localization?
what-desc-in-context=It allows you to localize web content in place, with context and spatial limitations right in front of you.
context=Understand context
context-desc=By localizing web page on the page itself, you no longer need to worry if the word you are translating is a verb or noun.
space=See spatial limitations
space-desc=Avoid breaking user interface by seeing how much space is available for your translations, which is especially useful with apps.
preview=Get instant preview
preview-desc=The moment you submit translation, it replaces the original text in the web page, making you the first proofreader and tester.

# How
how-title=How does it work?
how-desc-in-context=In-context localization is a very simple and intuitive tool that requires little to no technical skill for localizers to use.
hover=Hover
hover-sub=over web content
hover-desc=Move your mouse over headings, links, paragraphs or other text blocks on this page. A dashed rectangle will appear around each of these blocks, marking strings that are available for localization on the page itself.
select=Select
select-sub=a text block
select-desc=A toolbar appears above the dashed rectangle, allowing you to select the corresponding text block for editing. To do so, either click on the Edit button in the toolbar, or double-click anywhere inside the dashed border.
translate=Translate
translate-sub=selected text
translate-desc=When you enter editing mode, the entire text block will be selected. You can start typing your translation immediately while seeing the exact context of your source string and how much space is available for your translation.
save=Save
save-sub=your translation
save-desc=As soon as you are happy with your translation, you can save it by pressing Enter or clicking the save icon in the toolbar. To quit translation mode without saving changes, press Esc or click the cancel icon in the toolbar.
that-is-it=That's it!
